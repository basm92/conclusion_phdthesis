\section{Concluding Remarks}

In X, Dutch Lower House member and liberal politician Sam van Houten accused his fellow Lower House members of being an oligarchy, purposefully shirking their responsibility of contributing a fair share towards the state finances\footnote{I want to thank Jesper van der Most for bringing this quote to my attention}. His outburst marked the frustration experienced particularly by the liberal wing of the Lower House and society in general with the failure of the political elite to come to timely and appropriate solutions of the country's most important problems, in this case, the reform of the fiscal system. 

In a sense, the third and fourth chapter in this dissertation can be interpreted as a test of perspectives by e.g. \cite{tahoun2019personal} and \cite{grossman1996electoral}, who think that politicians have an indirect utility function of the form:

\begin{equation*}
    V(p) = \gamma (p) + \alpha U (p)
\end{equation*}

where $\gamma (p)$ represents the utility from monetary benefits (costs) of adopting a policy $p$, and $U (p)$ represents the utility to the politician by all other factors, for example, ideology, party discipline, or the general interest. The relative weight of these priorities is represented by $\alpha$. In the third chapter, my results show that the personal wealth of politicians influences their decision-making: richer politicians are more likely to vote against fiscal legislation than poorer politicians, everything else equal. This analysis exploits the progressivity of fiscal project laws, and finds that politicians who would be hit harder by the acceptance of a new piece of fiscal legislation are systematically less likely to accept the law than politicians who are poorer, conditional on party and a host of other controls. The instrumental variable analyses also provide support for a causal interpretation of these results. 

In the case of suffrage extension, and various placebo tests, where there is no direct effect between the acceptance of the law and the personal costs politicians bore in case of acceptance, there is no evidence for personal wealth playing a role. This shows that the personal profile of politicians impacted the acceptance of fiscal legislation, and thus, government size and the level of social spending. My interpretation is that certain exogenous economic shocks, which made politicians substantially poorer, have sufficiently mitigated the personal wealth-incentive for these laws to be accepted. 

In the fourth chapter, my analysis shows that there are significant returns to politics in the first period, equivalent to approx. a 5 percentage point yearly return on wealth over the remaining lifetime, and also equivalent to about 5-6 a yearly Ministers' salary. The results also show that there are little to no returns to a longer stay in politics, suggesting that the returns to politics are depletable. I rule out various alternative explanations, including the possibility that returns are obtained after a political career, for example, by a lucrative function in finance or in the colonies. My interpretation of these results focuses on the nature of the district system \citep{van2018tussen}, promoting close connections between (enfranchised) business leaders and the political representatives of the district. I also provide evidence of the influence of changing institutions on the returns to politics: in particular, I find that these returns are realized in periods when political parties did not exist. According to this analysis, political parties, then, are able to discipline politicians enough to make them refrain from engaging in self-interested activities. On the other hand, several other changing institutional changes, such as suffrage extensions, have not been able to influence the returns to politics \citep{ashworth2010does}.
