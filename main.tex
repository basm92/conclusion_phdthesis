\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

In [Year X], Dutch Lower House member and liberal politician Sam van Houten accused his fellow Lower House members of being an oligarchy, purposefully shirking their responsibility of contributing a fair share towards the state finances \citep{van2013eerste}. His outburst marked the frustration experienced particularly by the liberal wing of the Lower House and society in general with the collective failure of the political elite to come to timely and appropriate solutions of the country's most important problems, in this case, the reform of the fiscal system. 

Van Houten's claim can be decomposed into two aspects: first, he implied that his colleagues acted according to self-interest, attempting to preserve their own positions, rather than acting in the common interest of society. Second, that this has important consequences not only for the political system, but also for wider society. On the one hand, it would not be a surprise if Van Houten was right. \cite{smit2002omwille} documents a very long and protracted struggle around fiscal legislation, which first came to the surface in the 1870's, but was only resolved in 1893, twenty years later, with the establishment of an income tax. The Dutch income tax realized a more equal distribution of taxation, and spread the tax burden more evenly, and likely improved efficiency and social welfare. On the other hand, there might be numerous other reasons why politicians have decided to reject or delay the acceptance of laws, none of which might have something to do with self-interest. 

This dissertation can be seen as an attempt to unveil whether the conjectures of Van Houten were correct, and if so, what the consequences are of politicians pursuing their self-interest. In various chapters, I have analyzed the Dutch political elite in various aspects: I have outlined their personal interests by focusing on one of the most obvious objectives they would want to pursue: increasing their own wealth \citep{buchanan1989essays}. In addition, I have asked whether the persuasion of self-interests is apparent in political decision-making, and if so, what that would imply for the acceptance of several key laws in Dutch history with wide implications. In the penultimate chapter, I have turned to the questions whether and to what extent politicians can enrich themselves, and whether and how the political system enables or mitigates politicians' penchant to pursue their own interests. In this final chapter, I start by briefly recapitulating the most important findings of the preceding chapters (section \ref{sec:recap}). Afterwards, I come back to the implications for Dutch political history. I also argue that the research findings have broader implications, teaching us about the processes that led to the democratization of Western Europe in the late nineteenth century, and perhaps also more broadly about democratization more generally (section \ref{sec:reflection}). In addition, I argue that my findings call for a more explicit role of political elites, and in particular, intra-elite conflicts, in models that attempt to explain economic growth, franchise extension, or taxation. In tandem, I conclude by outlining several suggestions for further research (section \ref{sec:sfr}). 

%This dissertation started out by asking the question if, how, and to what extent a political elite prioritizes its self-interest, and how this phenomenon interrelates with democratization and a transitioning economy. 



\subsection{Recapitulation of the Main Chapters}\label{sec:recap}
The second chapter of this thesis started out by mapping out the wealth of Dutch politicians over time, in various representative bodies. In doing so, the chapter is supplementing the historical literature about the profile of Dutch politicians in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \citep{van1983toegang, secker1991ministers, van1999eerste, oomen2020werk} with a perspective that was ruled out before: \cite{van1983toegang} remarked that "the hypothesis that involves background factors having a predictive value for political behavior and political choices especially has turned out to be unprovable so far." This chapter can be seen as bringing new life to this way of thinking, making use of a a publicly available source, the \textit{Memories van Successie}, to get a detailed impression of politicians' personal wealth. This chapter laid bare a particularly large cleavage between the Lower and Upper Houses: whereas the lower house was a diverse place in terms of personal wealth, the upper house was exclusively dominated by extremely wealthy individuals, and this remained so throughout the period. Importantly, the data in the second chapter paved the way for asking analytical questions about the consequences of this wealth profile of the representative bodies, which are the subjects of the third and fourth chapters. 

In a sense, the third and fourth chapter in this dissertation can be interpreted as a test of perspectives by e.g. \cite{tahoun2019personal} and \cite{grossman1996electoral}, who think that politicians have preferences over policies that consist of a (monetary) self-interest component, and a general interest component, which might also include ideology. The empirical question is then what weight a potential self-interest component might have in their decision-making. In the third chapter, my results show that the personal wealth of politicians influences their decision-making: richer politicians are more likely to vote against fiscal legislation than poorer politicians, everything else equal. This analysis exploits the progressivity of fiscal law projects, and finds that politicians who would be hit harder by the acceptance of a new piece of fiscal legislation are systematically less likely to accept the law than politicians who are poorer, conditional on party and a host of other controls. The instrumental variable analyses also provide support for a causal interpretation of these results. 

I also analyze laws in which the effect of acceptance on personal wealth is not so clear \textit{a priori}, specifically, the case of suffrage extension. Additionally, I conduct various placebo tests, and find there is no effect between the acceptance of the law and the personal wealth of politicians, making it unlikely that personal wealth interests actually proxy something else. In sum, this shows that the personal profile of politicians impacted the acceptance of fiscal legislation, and thus, government size and the level of social spending. In terms of the conjectures by \cite{tahoun2019personal} and \cite{grossman1996electoral}, I thus find that the self-interested component is large enough to be detectable statistically. The coefficient on wealth is about five times as small as the coefficient on political party, the most important empirical determinant of voting behavior, allowing me to guess that ideology is about five times more important than self-interest. 

But if self-interest plays an important role in the choices of politicians, why have these laws still been accepted, to the detriment of their own interests? My interpretation makes use of the findings in chapter two and chapter three. In chapter two, I documented the wealth of politicians, and I also focused on the wealth of parliament over time. I observed a pattern of declining parliamentary wealth, which, over the entire period, meant that the median Lower House member was almost 10 times as poor in 1920 than the median Lower House member in 1870. In chapter three, I documented that the speed with which these key laws have been accepted accelerated in the 1900s and 1910s, whereas before, many predecessor law projects with roughly the same goal were rejected by parliament \citep{smit2002omwille, van2013eerste}. I think that there are two main factors underlying these patterns: the first is that certain exogenous economic shocks, which made politicians substantially poorer, have sufficiently mitigated the personal wealth-incentive for these laws to be accepted. Secondly, a part of this effect might have been exacerbated by the franchise extensions we have seen, which increased the diversity of parliament, including in wealth \citep{van1983toegang}. Thus, while there is no evidence of the influence of self-interested behavior in accepting suffrage extensions, these suffrage extensions themselves might have had an indirect effect on mitigating the role of self-interest in politics, through the selection of poorer politicians on average.

This consideration also brings me to the economic relevance of self-interest. The counterfactual scenarios constructed in chapter three imply that, for accepted laws to be rejected, politicians would have had to be richer by a factor of about ten, which is approximately the difference between the wealth of the median Lower House politician in 1870 (before the majority of reforms) and 1920 (afterwards). Conversely, for rejected laws around 1870 to be accepted, politicians would have had to be about 10 times poorer. This implies that the Lower House in 1914, had it been as wealthy as the Lower House in 1870, would likely have rejected the laws they have in fact accepted. Thus, coming back to the quote by \cite{van1983toegang} earlier, I interpret this as evidence of 'background factors', specifically personal wealth, playing a direct role in determining politicians' voting behavior. 

In the fourth chapter, my analysis shows that there are significant returns to politics in the first period, equivalent to approx. a 5 percentage point yearly return on wealth over the remaining lifetime, and also equivalent to about 5-6 a yearly Ministers' salary. The results also show that there are little to no returns to a longer stay in politics, suggesting that the returns to politics are depletable. I rule out various alternative explanations, including the possibility that returns are obtained after a political career, for example, by a lucrative function in finance or in the colonies, or that the results are due to electorates or parties detecting 'bad type' politicians \citep{besley1995does}. 

My interpretation of these results focuses on the nature of the district system \citep{van2018tussen}, promoting close connections between (enfranchised) business leaders and the political representatives of the district, and politicians being able to use their discretion in the lower house to accept law projects that are financially favorable to them, and reject laws that are not. I also provide evidence of the influence of changing institutions on the returns to politics: in particular, I find that these returns are realized in periods when political parties did not exist \citep[cf.][]{eggers2009mps}. This is additional evidence for the supposition that politicians used their discretion to their own financial advantage, hinting again at the existence of a monetary self-interest component in the utility function of politicians: after political parties were founded, party discipline decreased the level of autonomy and discretion of individual politicians \citep{de2001antirevolutionaire,de2014ons}. According to this analysis, political parties, then, are able to discipline politicians enough to make them refrain from engaging in self-interested activities. On the other hand, several other changing institutional changes, such as suffrage extensions, have not been able to influence the returns to politics \citep[see also][]{ashworth2010does}. 

\subsection{Reflection}\label{sec:reflection}

What are the most important insights?

What do we learn about the Netherlands?

What do we learn about theoretical models?

What do we learn about democratization in general?

What do we learn about methods? Possibilities and limitations

\subsubsection{Methods}

In this dissertation, I have used various causal inference methods to establish relationships between politicians' wealth and their political activity \citep{cunningham2021causal}. 

In chapter four, I have used regression discontinuity analysis revolving around close elections to investigate the treatment effects of a political career on personal wealth. 

\subsubsection{Data Sources}
This dissertation primarily relied on archival sources to collect probate inventories, \textit{Memories van Successie} (MVS), to obtain a reliable measure of politicians' personal wealth \citep{bos1990vermogensbezitters}. Probate inventories have many advantages: they provide a detailed appraisal of a politicians' wealth at the time of decease, and usually, also a detailed inventories consisting of their assets and liabilities, and a separate appraisal of each and every one of them. The completeness of the deceased's wealth had to be declared under oath, and regularly, the tax agency required descendants to file additional declarations of assets that were initially missing. This indicates that a significant amount of time was devoted to ensuring that an individual's full wealth served as the tax base. On the other hand, the MVS also have several disadvantages. For one, it is possible that despite oversight, individuals are still able to hide assets in various ways. To the extent this is done systematically, this potentially biases the results, possibly introducing measurement error or selection bias, or making the estimates less efficient \citep{angrist2008mostly}. Secondly, it provides an overview of an individual's assets at only one point in time, at the end of one's life. In view of life-cycle saving theories in finance, individuals might have various motives to systematically change the composition of their wealth, and anticipate bequests as they get older \citep{dynan2002importance}. 

More broadly, the MVS are available only once for each individual. Research using this data source must then necessarily rely on cross-sectional or cohort data, but cannot use inferential techniques using panel data. In the Netherlands, there exist few possible other sources to obtain a measure of individuals' wealth and income. One alternative source is the \textit{Kohieren van de Gemeentelijke Hoofdelijke Omslag} \citep{klep1987kohieren}, a source detailing municipal taxes paid at the individual-year level. In principle, this source would allow for repeated measurement of income on the basis of taxes paid, although there are a few reservations: the tax base is not the harmonized across municipalities, and the effective tax rate differs from municipality to municipality. Empirical strategies using municipal fixed effects could accommodate this, but various legal changes also complicate that, as municipality-wide average tax base and tax rates change over time. Unfortunately, there exist no systematic archival records of the nation-wide income tax studied in the second chapter of this dissertation. The availability of the so-called \textit{Kohieren van de (Rijks)inkomstenbelasting} is scarce, and highly dependent on the place and time. In specific situations, however, this source can be used for treatments at the more micro-level. This source is less suitable for studies like the ones conducted in preceding chapters, however, since they study a population that is geographically spread across the Netherlands. Both of the sources can usually be found in municipal archives (\textit{Stadsarchieven}) rather than provincial archives. 

There are also various other \textit{kohieren}, detailing taxes paid at the individual level related to various asset classes, e.g. real estate or shares. If one wants to study these asset classes specifically, these sources are suitable, but subject to the same limitations as the other \textit{kohieren}. Otherwise, if one wants to study wealth and income as a whole, these sources are heavily bias towards individuals with these specific assets. In sum, I think the MVS are still the most useful to study wealth and income, in terms of coverage, availability, and uniformity. Because of these characteristics, sources like the MVS still have ample opportunities to be used in the future on a scale larger than in this dissertation. Due to advances in deep learning \citep{shen2021layoutparser} and optical character recognition (OCR), I think it is possible to leverage more data and systematically collect, curate and analyze the MVS to study the effects of various interventions in difference-in-difference-like designs. A possible challenge to this process would be the OCR of largely hand-written sources. After about 1900, most of the MVS are typed on a typewrite rather than hand-written, likely facilitating OCR. 

Finally, although the MVS theoretically cover virtually the entire population, in practice, it is sometimes difficult to find specific individuals. In my opinion, this occurs principally because of two reasons. The law stipulates that individuals must file and register the MVS at the registration office managing the place of death. This principle is widely deviated from. For example, it is often difficult to find probate inventories of individuals who have died outside of the Netherlands, because there is no designated office. In addition, descendants of deceased individuals often do not file their declaration at the place of death, but rather, at the office close to the place in which they live, or with which they have a special cultural bonding. In this respect, biographical information about individuals to be found can help locate the likely place of the specific MVS. The second reason why individuals might be difficult to find has to do with archival organization. Oftentimes, individuals' assets are transferred from generation to generation, leading the civil servants administering the probate inventories to use probate inventories from previously deceased parents to investigate the assets of the deceased children. These probate inventories are sometimes not put back, and hence, leaves open a range of possible locations. In practice, I believe that after having considered the place of death and possibly the place of bonding, it is generally not worth the risk of conducting more search activity for a probate inventory in potentially different archives and places.  

% what about data availability? does it pay to look for more Memories or not? (answer: no)




\subsection{Suggestions for Further Research}\label{sec:sfr}

The situation in the nineteenth century confirms Dutch political historians' views in many ways. For instance, despite politicians prioritizing their own finances when voting on laws, chapter \ref{ch:three} confirms that the influence of ideology and party discipline was by far the strongest factor determining their voting behavior \citep[see e.g.][]{de2003het, de2014ons}. The results in chapter \ref{ch:three} can be interpreted as a lower bound of the influence of self-interest if self-interests also affect the decision of politicians to join a particular party.  The results in chapter \ref{ch:four} also show that political parties 

These two considerations suggest that the incentives to joining a political party should also be investigated.


%% 19e eeuwse situatie bevestigt theorie, partijdiscipline belangrijk

%% politici gedragen zich zoals je zou verwachten

%% politieke partijen, ideologie en candidate platform

%% toegang tot verkiezingen wordt daardoor bepaald door politici

%% benefits zo hoog, opwegen tegen opgeven van opportunisme


%% three points:

%% partijdiscipline argument wordt gesuggereeerd door mijn bevindingen in paper 3, verschil in rents tussen prot, kath en lib

What determines political party choice? This is also guided by self-interest, presumably. Secondly, what determines the party line? Is it influential ideologically-minded individuals, or is there also room for self-interest?


% empirisch: research design / find a way /strategy/situation to measure impact of political decision-making on politicians' wealth (?)
How can politicians obtain financial advantage exactly? Is it by voting favorable laws? Through projects, or is it due to asset returns? Are these opportunities depletable?


%% this below is suggested by my results of paper 2, ideology is very important and the political elite is split (lizzeri & persico paper) vs. acemoglu
Take into account politicians' personal profiles when modeling political economy: intra political-elite heterogeneity.




%Strategic voting behavior? How do politicians behave in parliament? %Do they reveal their preferences truthfully?

% party discipline dependent on time / issues on the table
Also, theoretically, it is interesting to look at the interaction between political party demands and politicians' own position: what determines the strength of party discipline.




Policy relevance: how to discipline politicians? More insight into personal finances might help if electorates consider it important enough. 

%% discipline versus ideology - empirical way to distinguish between them by using party splits

In the present-day Dutch context, party discipline has almost become absolute. Is there then no more room for abuse by politicians, and is the problem anachronistic? No, because now more subtle ways to prioritize self-interest. Plus, in many other countries, still possible because party discipline is looser. Analyze amendments rather than laws?
